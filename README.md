Geo analytics using Qlik, Leaflet and Mapbox
http://www.codewander.com/qlik-sense-extension-geo-analytics-leaflet-mapbox/


This Qlik sense Extension Geo Maps Leaflet Mapbox is my first attempt to explore Geo Analytics using leaflet and mapbox. 

Pre-Requisite

Before you use the extension, complete the following steps.
Create an account in Mapbox
  Once the account is created, generate an access token. Typically, you will have a default access token. However, its better to create     one for each application. I used the default access for this experiment. But you can customize it, if you are familiar with it.
  Keep the access token handy and you will use it in the extension
GetÂ  a sample data. For this example, I have used the sales sample data from http://www.sharecsv.com/s/9096d32f98aa0ac671a1cca16fa43be8/SalesJan2009.csv that contains latitude and longitude

Extension Details

Dimensions and Measures
There are three dimensions and 2 measures available in the extension
The first dimension gives the description of the geo space. If you plot country, then its a country name field. If you plot city then its a city field.
The second and third dimensions are latitude and longitude co-ordinates respectively.
The first measure is the value that will be displayed in the tool tip on click of the data points.
The second measure is optional and it determines the color of the data point. The result must be a color code.

Options

Mapbox Key: This is the API Token Key from the access token page of mapbox.
Begin Zoom Level: This is the zoom level at which the map will be loaded initially. A zero zoom level will have the map zoomed out.
Begin Latitude, Begin Longitude: These are settings that sets the center of the map view on load.
Max Zoom Level: This will restrict the zoom level that user can have on the map.
Market Size: This determines the size of the marker circle.
Market Color: The default marker color when the second measure is not present.
